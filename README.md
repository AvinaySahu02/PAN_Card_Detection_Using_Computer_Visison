# PAN_Card_Detection_Using_Computer_Visison
In this project, we will detect tampering of PAN Card using Computer Vision. This Project will help the different organizations in detecting whether the ID i.e. The PAN Card provided to them by their employees or customers or anyone is original or not. We take the original PAN Card images and compare all the images and check the similarity score to decide where PAN is Fake or Real. We can identify the PAN Card using plot difference, threshold, original and tampered image.
